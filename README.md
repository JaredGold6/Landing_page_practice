Self-reflection: After recreating the design provided, I have become much more confident in my html and css abilities. Starting this project off I knew 0 css and only a bit of html. Although the code is a bit all over the place and the css isn't perfect (I'll learn utilize cascade better someday). The ability to go from nothing but a few blank text documents to an official looking layout in a few days has shown me just how far I've come from knowing nothing. Javascript is next and its going to be exciting to learn even more.
